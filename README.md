# HyperX Battery Checker
Finds the battery level of HyperX headsets.
NGENUITY takes around forever to update the headset battery and I got tired of opening the app all the time, so I made a program that updates it automatically.

# Supported Devices
- HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 Wireless (the product ID and the vendor ID are already stored in the program)

# How to install
Windows-only program. To install, you need the "hidapi" library, which can be installed using:
``pip install hidapi``
You may need to install the Visual Studio build tools to install hidapi.

# Plans
- Make a taskbar icon that refreshes the battery level and updates periodically.
